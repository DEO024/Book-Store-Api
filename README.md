# Bookstore Inventory System API Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an advanced bookstore inventory system focusing solely on the API side using Spring Boot. The system will provide a robust API for managing books, authors, categories, and orders, adhering to modern software construction principles and practices.

## Tools and Technologies Used
 **IDE:**
 Visual Studio Code

- **Project Setup:** 
Spring Initializr


- **Dependencies:** 
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - JWT Authentication

- **Database:** 
MySQL

- **Database Management Tool:** 

MySQL Workbench
- **API Documentation:** Swagger

- **Testing Frameworks:** 
Thunder client

## Project Description
The project is divided into multiple milestones, with each milestone focusing on different aspects of the system development. Candidates will have two weeks to complete the project.

### Milestones Overview

#### Milestone One: Setup and Configuration 
- Use Spring Initializr to set up a new Spring Boot project.
- Select required dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security.
- Configure database integration with MySQL using Hibernate.
- Implement basic CRUD operations for managing books, authors, and categories following RESTful API design principles.
- Ensure separation of concerns and adherence to SOLID principles in the initial project setup.

#### Milestone Two: Authentication and Authorization
- Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT authentication.
- Design and implement secure endpoints for user registration, login, and role management.
- Secure API endpoints based on user roles, ensuring proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

#### Milestone Three: Order Management 
- Develop features for managing orders, including order creation, retrieval, update, and cancellation.
- Implement order-related endpoints adhering to RESTful API best practices.
- Ensure that only authenticated users can place orders and that order-related operations are performed securely.

#### Milestone Four: Advanced Features and Enhancements (20%)
- Implement additional features such as search functionality, pagination, and filtering for books, authors, and categories.
- Enhance error handling and validation for user inputs, providing meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes.
- Implement versioning for APIs to handle backward compatibility and API evolution gracefully.

#### Milestone Five: Testing, Documentation, and CI/CD (20%)
- Write comprehensive unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the correctness and reliability of implemented features.
- Generate detailed API documentation using Swagger, documenting API endpoints, request/response structures, and usage examples.
- Document the project setup, architecture, design decisions, and any other relevant information in a clear and concise manner.
- Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices.
